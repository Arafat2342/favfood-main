            Melted Parmesan and mozzarella cheese, and a peppery, garlicky tomato sauce drizzled <br> over the top of a chicken fillet – Aussie pub-goers claim this ostensibly Italian dish as their <br> own. Since they make it so well, there’s no point in arguing.

                    A crispy, rice-batter crepe encases a spicy mix of mashed potato, which is then dipped in <br> coconut chutney, pickles, tomato-and-lentil-based sauces and other condiments. It’s a <br> fantastic breakfast food that’ll keep you going till lunch, when you’ll probably come back <br> for another.

                    So, who’s up for a chunk of monkfish liver with a little grated daikon on the side? Thought <br> not – still, you’re missing out on one of sushi’s last great secrets, the prized ankimo. The <br> monkfish/anglerfish that unknowingly bestows its liver upon upscale sushi fans is <br> threatened by commercial fishing nets damaging its sea-floor habitat, so it’s possible <br> ankimo won’t be around for much longer. If you do stumble across the creamy, yet oddly <br>light delicacy anytime soon, consider a taste – you won’t regret trying one of the best foods <br> in Japan.

                    This snack made from pork, shrimp, herbs, rice vermicelli and other ingredients wrapped in <br> rice paper is served at room temperature. It’s “meat light,” with the flavors of refreshing <br> herbs erupting in your mouth. Dipped in a slightly sweet Vietnamese sauce laced with <br> ground peanuts, it’s wholesome, easy and the very definition of “moreish.”
